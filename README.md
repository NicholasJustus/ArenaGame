Arena FPS – Unreal Engine 5 Project

This is a solo project I’m working on for my **Information Technology and Digital Games** class (GAM 207) at SNHU. It’s a first-person arena shooter built in **Unreal Engine 5** where the player fights off waves of AI enemies in a closed arena.

The main goal is to get hands-on experience with Unreal and apply what we’re learning in the course — things like player controls, AI, game logic, and UI.

Features

- First-person movement and shooting
- Basic arena map
- AI enemies that chase and attack the player
- Health and damage system
- (In progress) score tracking, wave system, and UI elements

Tools Used

- Unreal Engine 5
- Blueprints (may add some C++ later)
- GitHub for version control
- Git Bash for commits and pushes
